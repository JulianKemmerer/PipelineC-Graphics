# PipelineC-Graphics

Graphics demos implemented using [PipelineC](https://github.com/JulianKemmerer/PipelineC).

This primarily consists of a ray tracing demo created using [CflexHDL](https://github.com/suarezvictor/CflexHDL) C++ code.

Work contained in these repositories is experimental and in active development. Please [report any issues](https://github.com/JulianKemmerer/PipelineC-Graphics/issues) that are encountered.

# Sphery vs. Shapes:

A fully working interactive raytraced game written in C and translated to a circuit. No CPU is used, and the few resources used run at an outstanding power efficiency. Check out a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8jlJapQbFY) of gameplay on real hardware!

A detailed article describing this work wil be released soon!
